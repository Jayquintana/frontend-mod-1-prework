## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

My workflow defiantly improves with this technique, makes my mind reflect more and obtain more information. I will say the hard part is keeping up with taking a consistent break especially when i'm stuck.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I found the Pomodoro technique tough to start getting in the habit of. The first couple of times I sat down to do assessments and some of the pre-work I would tend to forget to take a break or ignore it. After a couple of times it seemed very helpful to set timing goals, sometimes I spend too much time on one thing and will watch time pass withought realizing


3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

Objects are used as a way to store a collection of various collections of complex data.
Arrays and Objects are Similar with some key differences.

Arrays store an ordered list of data. Each item in the array can be accessed using only numbers, or the index of item.


Objects store data but instead of using only index positions to get the data, you can use Strings. This lets you treat an object like it's a database for storing and organizing data. Below is the syntax of an object.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  `Array`
  * List of states and their capitals
  `Object`
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  `Array`
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  `Array`
  * List of student names and their cohort
  `Object`
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  `Object`
  * All my favorite restaurants
  `Array`

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Another Object in a web application could be a single song in SoundCloud. It contains a collection of information of the songs data, for example: Length of the song, How many plays it has, who has commented, and the number of likes/reposts.


6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
