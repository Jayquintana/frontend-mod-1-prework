## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

Asking questions is a great tool to use to not only work through a problem, but to ultimately learn something new, and save loads of time. I can become insecure about asking questions so I tend to wait too long. Asking for help is something I am woking and learning to implement here at my time in Turing.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It was tough trying to learn the `functions` section on my own, I was expecting some of the questions to contain things I had just learned and when not specified that we hadn't gone over a certain section in the pre-work and the JavaScript book. I had thought maybe it was a trick question and spent entirely too long on a problem looking through my notes and googling. Ultimately I got the answers I was looking for and tuned up my googling technique.`

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement tells the code what to do in a given situation. It works within if, then, and else statements.`

A real life conditional could be found in basketball. When given the ball you have to analyze the court and see where your opponent is going. If you cross your opponent and they move back, you then should shoot the ball. If not (else) you should pass the ball.

You can find a conditional statements in web applications within anything that needs login credentials, the conditional will decide if your credentials are correct. Then is sends you to the website, if the credentials are incorrect. It may ask you to try again.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add multiple conditions to an `if` statements you create a secondary statement called `else if`. The way the code gets read is from the first `if` statement, to the next, down to the `else` statement. If the first if statement is true it will disregard the rest of the code and move on. If it is false, the program then reads the next else if statement and does the same thing it did for the first `if` statement. It checks if its true or false and either moves on or reads the next line of code.




5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

I can run the code in a virtual machine online that can run js. Or I can double check the conditions and make sure that the output is set to what I want. Check to see if the `if` statements are correct, and check the `else if` statements and `else` statement to make sure when those don't come out true the program has something else to run.



6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

My only questions are with the functions. When the output is set to the console.log and we give our function a parameter argument. How does it choose which one to run, or if we either do one or the other. I also had trouble with the last functions question.
