sentence## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

**"A learning journey is a curated collection of learning assets, both formal and informal, that can be used to acquire skills for a role and/or a technology area" Sonia Malik IMB**

This quote stuck out to me because she refers to learning as a journey, which in my past history of education ``(High school)``
I probably wouldn't have agreed. Now in Turing it seems like learning is defiantly going to be a journey.

The one thing i already do from this list is read, but that is still something i would like to incorporate more of, I don't read as much as I would like to.

I want to start adopting a growth mindset, strive for growing and learning instead of feeling insecure about it.

I also want to start teaching what I know, sometimes I see questions in slack that I could answer, but I get insecure of my knowledge and if is correct or not. so I want to implement that more because it would not only benefit m but the person asking.


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

**Strings**

A *string* is a data type consisting of letters, special characters and numbers wrapped in quotes. A string is useful for a name of a thing, writing a sentence, to adding an address of a location.

**Number**

A data type that deals with all *numbers*. Negative, positive, decimals and whole numbers. The numbers data type is useful for prices, quantity, speeds, and anything that involves a number.


**Boolean**

A *boolean* is a data type that deals in `True or False`. A boolean will measure if a variable is either true or false. These are helpful when dealing with yes or no questions in coding.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```javascript
var h = "Hello World!"

console.log(h)

```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

to make a code comment you either use ``// two backslashes `` for one line of code or for a longer comment of code you use ``/* to start and end it in */``

*Code comments* are helpful for other developers reviewing your work, or for when you leave a project for a long period of time and have to come back. Either way it is a useful form of communication for the person understating the code written.


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A *variable* is like the tortilla of a burrito. A burrito holds specific meats, and food types inside of it. You can decipher what kind of burrito it is depending on what food is inside. Breakfast burritos have eggs, chorizo, potatoes, and either beacon or sausage. We know its a breakfast burrito because of the type of food inside. The same goes with variables except the tortilla is the variable, and data types are meats and food inside. Depending on the data type you have inside your variable will decide what kind of variable it will be.



6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

An app I use frequently is Spotify, There can be thousands of variables inside of that app. Some could be the song names, which would be a *string*. The length and timing of the song *3:42* which would be a *float* or number data type. A *boolean* would be if the song is playing or not, or if you're in a specific playlist or not.


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

A concatenation is a way to add/join things together in a string. You have the ability to add strings together or add Numbers data types into a string together and it will add/read the numbers as a string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?


Going back to Spotify, developers probably use concatenation when maybe adding a feature to a song. When there is a feature on a song, the person is within the artists names, and you can actually click that name. It will direct you to that artists profile that is featured. So I imagine that the name is holding data already written, so instead of writing new code to do that action that just use concatenation to join it within the name and within that specific song.


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I still might be a little foggy on what concatenation, I hope what I explained before is a common use for it. Everything els i am good on though.
