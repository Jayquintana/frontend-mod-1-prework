## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

    There were a couple of points that stuck out to me but the main two that resonated were. **comparing yourself to others**, the act of looking around and see what others have accomplished and not looking back to what you've accomplished.

    The second would be making mental check notes, she said that when she makes a mental list of what she is struggling with. Then she thinks about how she is going to fix it.


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

Comparing myself is something i've struggled with for a while but have recently learned to Accept that things will come with time and work.

Making mental action notes is something I have done for a while. Whenever I feel like i'm struggling with something I will try to be self aware. Log my struggles and figure out what to do to get them done or fixed.


3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Arrays could be used in Logic. Logic is a software for music and it had preloaded loops and sounds you can use that are categorized. Im sure they use arrays to organize each sound in each category, and to list each function of the sound.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is an action applied to an array, that can list, add, remove, or change elements within an array.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to run a code block several times so we wouldn't have to do it manually. It usually has a set number of times it runs or runs until a variable is false.

You would use a loop within an array to either print out the elements, sort them, or run any type of condition within an arrays elements a certain number of times to have different outputs.

You can loops other types of code blocks like strings, conditions, integers to do math...etc.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is like If we had remote control cars on a race track, and we had unlimited battery and power. We have to tell the race cars how many laps to go, and when to stop. If they have to go forward or backward. Anything we want to be in our race to make it easier or harder we can tell it to do. 

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
